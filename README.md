# Chest X-Ray Image Classification 🩻
## Deep Learning-Based Comparative Analysis of CNN Architectures

This project replicates and compares various deep learning models for classifying chest X-ray images into **COVID-19**, **Pneumonia**, and **Normal** classes. It serves both as an academic study and a practical demonstration of medical imaging analysis using CNN-based architectures.

## 🧪 Results Snapshot

| Model         | Test Accuracy | F1-Score |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| VGG19         | 97%           | 0.97     |
| VGG + CNN     | 97%           | 0.97     |
| CNN Model 1   | 95%           | 0.95     |
| CNN Model 2   | 94.5%         | 0.95     |
| ResNet50      | 87.5%         | 0.88     |
| Xception      | 35%           | 0.35     |

> Note: Xception underperformed likely due to overfitting or domain mismatch.
