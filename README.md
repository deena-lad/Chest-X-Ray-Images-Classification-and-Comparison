# Chest X-Ray Image Classification: Comparative Deep Learning Study

This project replicates and compares state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for classifying chest X-ray images into three categories: **COVID-19**, **Pneumonia**, and **Normal**. The study implements models such as **CNN**, **VGG16**, **VGG19**, **ResNet50**, **Xception**, and a **Hybrid VGG19+CNN**.

## üß† Techniques Used
- Convolutional Neural Networks (Custom)
- Pretrained Architectures: VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, Xception
- Transfer Learning
- Data Augmentation
- Preprocessing: CLAHE, Normalization, Noise Reduction

## üß™ Dataset
- Source: Mendeley Data
- Classes: COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia
- Total: ~5200 images
- All resized to 256√ó256 and split into 80:20 train:test

## üìä Results
- Best Models: VGG19, Hybrid VGG19+CNN
- Metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Training/Validation Loss

| Model         | Test Accuracy | F1-Score |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| VGG19         | 97%           | 0.97     |
| VGG + CNN     | 97%           | 0.97     |
| CNN Model 1   | 95%           | 0.95     |
| ResNet50      | 87.5%         | 0.88     |
